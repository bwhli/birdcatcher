# BirdCatcher

BirdCatcher is a Python API for timestamping tweets using ICON's IRC-31 token standard.

IRC-31 allows for multiple tokens to be minted with a single smart contract, wich each token being represented as a unique ID number. On Twitter, every tweet is represented by an ID number, which makes IRC-31 the perfect tool for the job.
